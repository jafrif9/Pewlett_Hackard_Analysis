## Summary
In a perfect scenerio, all of the roles will need to be filled. However, since most of the retiring employees are either senior engineers or senior staff, it would be beneficial to fill those positions first as those departments are likely to have the largest impact. Pewlett Hackard does not have enough employees that can mentor the next generation. Out of all of those retiring, only about 2%, or 1549, employees are able to mentor those taking over their positions. In order to overcome the "silver tsunami", Pewlett Hackard will have to hire many new employees in a short amount of time.
